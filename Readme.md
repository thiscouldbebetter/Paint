-----------

This repository depends on the TarFileExplorer submodule, so to o pull a copy for development, it will be helpful to run the Git "clone" command with the "--recursive" switch, like this:

> git clone --recursive https://github.com/thiscouldbebetter/Paint

Alternately, if a non-recursive clone operation has already been performed, you may run the command "git submodule update --init ." from within the empty TarFileExplorer directory.
